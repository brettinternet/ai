#### End a session before auto-compact:

> Create a comprehensive basic-memory documentation of this entire conversation session. The documentation should include: "Date & Time Stamp", "Session Overview", "Technical Findings", "Current State", "Context for Continuation", "Next Action Ready", "Anything Else of Importance/Worth Mentioning". Structure this as a detailed session note that would allow a new agent to immediately understand the complete context, technical state, and overall state of the workspace to continue where we left off. Update basic-memory with the context of this entire conversation. From the initial interaction and user input to this point. Make sure to include enough context so that if I wanted to continue from where we left in this conversation, in another brand new conversation, that I could start a new conversation by asking the agent to read from notes and continue where we left off and the agent will have complete understanding going forward.
